And you disappointed us. I\u2019ve not heard people cry for spending too much in your brother December and having little in your\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>Not that we really wanted you to be blue. We\u2019re used to patterns and the obvious. You became Mourinho. And mind games became your\u00a0forte.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve come to pass swiftly. Very unusual of you. We\u2019ve known you to have extra days in your bag. Like in the past year I counted 44 days in your name. This time you seemed like 28\u00a0only.</p>\n<p>Now, there\u2019s only one distress when you pass on quickly: paying of monthly bills. That\u2019s something all of us (who stay in rented apartments) don\u2019t like. We dread moments of landlord visitations. Not to check on us but to seek what\u2019s due to\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>The fear will fade when you let your followers get my paycheck.</p>\n<p>On we\u00a0go\u2026.</p>\n<p>What made you run out fast? Now we\u2019re in February. A different February with an extra day. Will the extra day make a difference in the 366? That\u2019s what am looking forward to when we get to the end of the tether. Please pass my message to February for her to be compassionate to me. Let me earn in her\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>But for now, what did I do in your\u00a0time?</p>\n<p>In your time I learnt to <strong>appreciate and love family</strong> for the times I have them. God forbid! They can pass on but you\u2019ve to push\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>In your time I learnt that you need to <strong>commit to small routines to form habits</strong>. So, if you want to stop or start something, do it in small bits and it will grow to be an\u00a0asset.</p>\n<p>In your time I learnt through a CD of <strong>being adaptable</strong> to that my ambitions can fit in this small world. Where mountains don\u2019t meet but\u00a0people.</p>\n<p>In your time I enjoyed the comfort you offered. You made sure it rained. So, I could not smell the dust. Your past namesakes are usually very warm. But you changed this year to be cool enough for me to be homely. Should I thank you? Or you were not really in control. Still, am thinking you had something to do with the\u00a0weather.</p>\n<p>In your time, you shoved me into looking at things with a second eye. Is it enough to get only the first premise? Why not get as many premises? Having options makes you powerful. Powerful to make doors where there were\u00a0none.</p>\n<p>Now those are the highlights of what happened in your time. Am happy and grateful for your\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>When you hand over the baton to Feb tell her to be resplendent (been fighting my fairies to use\u00a0it)</p>\n<p>I await with pleasure to see your memo reach Feb. I\u2019ll evaluate if you really are a good listener and follow through with what I tell\u00a0you.</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>This year am trying to keep a monthly journal where I creatively speak to my months what they have offered me. And what I would like for the months that are yet to pass. So, lean forward and glean my learning positions.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see a journal reflecting upon what has already happened.

They end up serving themselves. You plan in the head, you\u2019ll manage with either if one fails. Then it comes to pass both were\u00a0really</p>\n<p>The other day I had two meetings, one hour apart in a city where traffic is a nightmare! One with a Creative D whose agency I wished to join the team, the other\u2026 let\u2019s just say am a job hunter. So, had to kill two meetings with me and\u00a0traffic.</p>\n<p>Had promised myself to be early. To be early meant making an impression \ud83d\ude09 on the CD. And finishing up quite early to have enough moments to carry my body to the next\u00a0meeting.</p>\n<p>Did I live up to my promise? Your guess is as good as mine. Didn\u2019t make it early enough. And instead, I was racing against time. And finally had to let him know I was running late. A very big disappointment. To my ambition. And by the wait, the CD had to go\u00a0through.</p>\n<p>And I was in\u00a0town.</p>\n<p>In between the fluster tailing me, I had to make a brief meetup on short notice. According to the person on the phone earlier, the situation was parlous. He met me and I relieved him. About what we discussed\u2026it\u2019s a story for another\u00a0day.</p>\n<p>Note my cruise to meeting the CD had taken a break as if to catch a breath. It also involved boarding 2 matatus. And by now I had managed to beat the first one. I too had managed to finish a first freakish\u00a0meetup.</p>\n<p>On the second bus, time was flying and passengers were not boarding promptly. I grew impatient. And peeked at my wristwatch how late I was with every passing second. For moments, I wished time could stop. But then time does not wait for no\u00a0man.</p>\n<p>My nerves were on a race. Thoughts raced through my\u00a0mind.</p>\n<p>Could I possibly pull and Eliud Kipchoge? And at least cut the waiting\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>But then have never run for a long time. So, I lacked the stamina and breath to pull the run. <br>In the nervy moments of wait, I appointed myself the makanga. I would glance painfully at the empty seats. And would count the extra number of passengers needed to fill the bus. Here my numeracy skills were put to\u00a0test.</p>\n<p>In my heart, I would count the empty seats and would proceed to start counting the passengers getting\u00a0in.</p>\n<p>I would go on to wish any passerby would board our bus. Unfortunately, not all would get in as if they had earlier chatted with Miguna. And inspired by \u2018am not boarding\u2019 wave.</p>\n<p>Amidst all this confusion and nervousness one my soul was kept at peace: \u2018if the role I was looking to fill was mine then it would be mine\u2019. I comforted myself.</p>\n<p>With being philosophical. And calling God\u2019s name when I had played a part in getting late. Still, God forgives our transgressions when we\u00a0sin.</p>\n<p>Did the bus get full?<br>Eventually, passengers filled the bus. I was happy. Though late, there was hope finally I would meet my\u00a0CD.</p>\n<p>In hope, I wanted the bus to grow wings. And speed up. However, it was only wishful thinking. It couldn\u2019t be possible. What the driver would possibly do is drive faster. Oh! My wish. But drivers are not mindreaders. So, I went by the CD to be patient for the dreaded journey.<br>\u2026</p>\n<p>Yet another wait. After the first meetup, I was needed somewhere else. Or rather I needed to attend another meetup. This meetup was also timed. Even more crucial than the first. With this one, I had no luxury of time-wasting. Had to be spot\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>Did I tell you how the first meetup went? It went\u00a0well.</p>\n<p>I learnt a lot. First and very important: you can do anything in your life. It\u2019s not too late. It\u2019s only late when you\u2019re dead. And even at the point of eternal rest, you\u2019re doing something different. Offering value to the mites in the underworld.</p>\n<p>The second lesson that supports the first is to be a student of human nature. Human nature guides most of our interactions. And can help you fit your ambitions into the\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>To culminate the learning session I learnt if all does not go well and according to your plan BE ADAPTABLE.</p>\n<p>I finished the meetup with a see you around.

I laugh about\u00a0it.</p>\n<p>He then asks if am rushing somewhere. To which I glean him am headed to an interview.

They end up serving themselves. You plan in the head, you\u2019ll manage with either if one fails. Then it comes to pass both were\u00a0really</p>\n<p>The other day I had two meetings, one hour apart in a city where traffic is a nightmare! One with a Creative D whose agency I wished to join the team, the other\u2026 let\u2019s just say am a job hunter. So, had to kill two meetings with me and\u00a0traffic.</p>\n<p>Had promised myself to be early. To be early meant making an impression \ud83d\ude09 on the CD. And finishing up quite early to have enough moments to carry my body to the next\u00a0meeting.</p>\n<p>Did I live up to my promise? Your guess is as good as mine. Didn\u2019t make it early enough. And instead, I was racing against time. And finally had to let him know I was running late. A very big disappointment. To my ambition. And by the wait, the CD had to go\u00a0through.</p>\n<p>And I was in\u00a0town.</p>\n<p>In between the fluster tailing me, I had to make a brief meetup on short notice. According to the person on the phone earlier, the situation was parlous. He met me and I relieved him. About what we discussed\u2026it\u2019s a story for another\u00a0day.</p>\n<p>Note my cruise to meeting the CD had taken a break as if to catch a breath. It also involved boarding 2 matatus. And by now I had managed to beat the first one. I too had managed to finish a first freakish\u00a0meetup.</p>\n<p>On the second bus, time was flying and passengers were not boarding promptly. I grew impatient. And peeked at my wristwatch how late I was with every passing second. For moments, I wished time could stop. But then time does not wait for no\u00a0man.</p>\n<p>My nerves were on a race. Thoughts raced through my\u00a0mind.</p>\n<p>Could I possibly pull and Eliud Kipchoge? And at least cut the waiting\u00a0time.</p>\n<p>But then have never run for a long time. So, I lacked the stamina and breath to pull the run. <br>In the nervy moments of wait, I appointed myself the makanga. I would glance painfully at the empty seats. And would count the extra number of passengers needed to fill the bus. Here my numeracy skills were put to\u00a0test.</p>\n<p>In my heart, I would count the empty seats and would proceed to start counting the passengers getting\u00a0in.</p>\n<p>I would go on to wish any passerby would board our bus. Unfortunately, not all would get in as if they had earlier chatted with Miguna. And inspired by \u2018am not boarding\u2019 wave.</p>\n<p>Amidst all this confusion and nervousness one my soul was kept at peace: \u2018if the role I was looking to fill was mine then it would be mine\u2019. I comforted myself.</p>\n<p>With being philosophical. And calling God\u2019s name when I had played a part in getting late. Still, God forgives our transgressions when we\u00a0sin.</p>\n<p>Did the bus get full?<br>Eventually, passengers filled the bus. I was happy. Though late, there was hope finally I would meet my\u00a0CD.</p>\n<p>In hope, I wanted the bus to grow wings. And speed up. However, it was only wishful thinking. It couldn\u2019t be possible. What the driver would possibly do is drive faster. Oh! My wish. But drivers are not mindreaders. So, I went by the CD to be patient for the dreaded journey.<br>\u2026</p>\n<p>Yet another wait. After the first meetup, I was needed somewhere else. Or rather I needed to attend another meetup. This meetup was also timed. Even more crucial than the first. With this one, I had no luxury of time-wasting. Had to be spot\u00a0on.</p>\n<p>Did I tell you how the first meetup went? It went\u00a0well.</p>\n<p>I learnt a lot. First and very important: you can do anything in your life. It\u2019s not too late. It\u2019s only late when you\u2019re dead. And even at the point of eternal rest, you\u2019re doing something different. Offering value to the mites in the underworld.</p>\n<p>The second lesson that supports the first is to be a student of human nature. Human nature guides most of our interactions. And can help you fit your ambitions into the\u00a0world.</p>\n<p>To culminate the learning session I learnt if all does not go well and according to your plan BE ADAPTABLE.</p>\n<p>I finished the meetup with a see you around. Weirdly enough, I have never come around to know the best way to end up a meetup. In hesitation, most times I do the \u2018see you around and thank you for your\u00a0time\u2019.</p>\n<p>The meetup ended and I look forward to working with the CD in future as he awaits my response of sending him my CV for his evaluation.</p>\n<p>Where was I in my wait for passengers to fill the\u00a0bus?</p>\n<p>I am in a rich suburb.
